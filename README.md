### Description

- You can follow these steps to create sign in with Facebook [Facebook for Developers-web](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web)
- First of all, go to Facebook developers website and then sign in with your Facebook account.
- Click Create App and choose Facebook Login product to include sign in with Facebook in your app.
- After that, you can include essential code from [Facebook for Developers-web](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web) and App ID from Facebook developers to include JavaScript SDK and make log in with Facebook button.
- If you can see log in with Facebook button appear, it will not be able to use because of invalid url.
- You should go back to Facebook developers and create test app and you will receive new App ID for testing environment.
- You have to change your App ID before testing and only your Facebook id will be enable to test.
- If you are satisfied with your app, you can change your App ID back to the original.
- Before you will make your app be public which means everyone can use your sign in with Facebook button, you have to fill up policy url which I recommend [TermsFeed](https://www.termsfeed.com/) to create that privacy policy.
- Eventually, everyone can use your sign in with Facebook when your app is live. Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
